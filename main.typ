= Introduction

3D reconstruction and perception is a foundational problem in computer vision driving multiple industries and problem spaces such as robotics, manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, logistics and warehousing, agriculture, and more recently construction, surveying, and geomatics #todo[fields need citations]. In the recent years, photogrammetry (image-based 3D reconstruction and measurements) has been gaining interest #todo[citation]. Regular colored images contain vast amount of information, are very accessible and cheap, easy to understand by humans.
- photogrammetry, image-based 3d reconstruction, is very popular and hot topic

// keep this one sentence
- Multi-View Stereo (MVS) produces highly accurate and dense point clouds

// make this more concrete: pixels * views * taps * iterations; cite ETH3D 24 MP images
- the problem of MVS is the amount of data it has to process

// this is the best sentence in the sketch; faster algos directly lead to better quality -> they can use higher resolution / or more sophisticated methods in the optimization
- this is a problem in highly accurate and/or large-scale 3D reconstruction (with faster algorithms, 3D models could become higher quality because the reconstruction could use higher resolution images or more sophisticated algorithms to improve point accuracy)

// The paper says its 24 MP images “encourage the development of memory and computationally efficient methods which can handle very large datasets.” The benchmark’s own authors expected efficiency to be rewarded.
- Another important event was that Schöps et al., CVPR 2017 introduced ETH3D dataset which created an easy way to measure algorithmic performance and with it, and with this dataset, dozens of algorithms were released with papers competing with each other on the benchmarks.

/*
needs evidence in literature review but this is a strong point
“Benchmarks don't measure efficiency”: the accurate version is a better argument
ETH3D collects runtime (“mandatory information for each submission”) but ranks by F1 alone. Runtimes are self-reported without hardware. About 170 of 630 rows show ≥ 999 999 s placeholders. ACMMP, APD-MVS, APDe-MVS, HPM-MVS, HPM-MVS++, MP-MVS and DPE-MVS all list 10⁷ s. The counts are approximate, from a snapshot taken 30 Oct 2026; archive it.
Efficiency is requested but not scored.
Gipuma said the same of KITTI and Middlebury in 2015. Middlebury v3 and KITTI show size-normalised runtimes but still rank by error.

(i) Archiving and citing the leaderboard
- Public archive: submit both the default view and the runtime view (?metric=time) to the Wayback Machine and archive.today. Then open each snapshot and check the numbers actually appear, because the table may be filled in by JavaScript and come out empty.
- Private copy: save the page as HTML and as a full-page PDF, record a SHA-256 hash of each, and keep them in the vault, not the superproject that's going public.
- The count: "~170 of 630 rows" is an agent's approximate count. Under your rule that manuscript numbers come from scripts, add a small parser that reads the archived HTML and outputs the counts and the lineage methods' runtimes. The ledger claim then cites that query.
- Citation: cite the ETH3D paper for what the benchmark intends, and add a @misc entry for the leaderboard with url, urldate = 2026-10-30 and the archive URL in note. The follow-up file has the BibTeX. In the text, put the date on the observation: "As of 30 October 2026, the ETH3D leaderboard lists 10⁷ s for ...".

- The benchmarks doesn't measure and score algorithmic or implementation efficiency, ACM-family was built on Gipuma, then the contenders started to tweaking the original ACM algorithms further and further with introducing more and more constraints into the algorithm such as multiple-scales (adding more iterations), geometric consistency (adding another geometric consistency propagation after the photometric consistency), planar priors (stricter loss function), confidence sweeps (new postprocessing), DL priors (additional deep learning pre-processing), leading to higher quality in the benchmarks but also making them infeasible in production-grade large-scale photogrammetry problems due to increased runtime. Today's top 10 ETH3D are all PatchMatch hybrids led by DVP-MVS++ at 90.23 2cm f1 score.


- The thesis claims that many of the algorithms slowness comes from implementation inefficiency inherited from the lineage of the developing algorithm family.

/* BACKGROUND */
/* ---------- */

- early 3D reconstruction algorithms were inefficient because they were using large cost-volumes to store costs for the optimization problem. Voxel-based 3D reconstructions discretise the scene into a voxel grid. Their accuracy is bounded by voxel grid's resolution. Large-scale high resolution reconstruction is infeasible due to the cubic memory growth in the grid resolution #todo[cite steven1999_voxel_coloring.pdf]. Also MVS problems require going through all pixels in all images and matching that with other pixels in other images which is a really compute-intensive task. with the huge leaps in GPU technology in the last decade there has been a great demand for highly parallel MVS algorithms that can map to GPUs efficiently. But GPUs generally have limitations on the amount of memory that they can utilize thus limiting the scale of the 3D reconstruction problem.
- patch match history:
  - PatchMatch algorithm for interactive editing: Barnes et al. 2009
  - Bleyer 2011 slanted planes for stereo, strictly sequential, authors call a GPU port an obvious idea but they didn't do it
  - bailer 2012: row column paralellize (useful info: their depth-map filtering step is dominated by I/O which a production ready implementation can easily resolve by background i/o threads)
  - shen 2013: same seemingly independent paper moving patchmatch from two-views into multi-view. In a sentence, we can state that "Bailer2012 and Shen2013 carried PatchMatch from two-view stereo to multi-view stereo"
  - zhen 2014: single-neighbor alternating sweeps on GPU then they implemented a parallel version of this algorithm that could paralellize across 1 axis of images at the time, doing sweeps.
  - COLMAP uses Zheng sweeps
  - Gipuma 2015: 50s -> 2.7s, a paper with great focus on PatchMatch efficiency, introduced the checkerboard propagation which created a highly efficient MVS algorithm. They also have a fast mode that uses algorithmic approximation

//  Kriegel et al. 2017:
// - It's in Knowledge and Information Systems 52:341–378 and labelled as a survey paper. Its key line: runtimes of one algorithm "can differ by several orders of magnitude due to implementation differences, without actual algorithmic differences". It also argues for exactly your design: compare implementations in the same framework, at the same level of optimisation. Their field is clustering and outlier detection, so cite it as the general precedent, with your thesis as the MVS case.

problem formulation, claims, RQs, contributions from thesis itself and how the thesis is structured

(budget 4 pages)

==== RQ1
To what extent is the cost growth across successive patch-match MVS algorithms attributable to genuine algorithmic complexity versus inherited implementation inefficiency?

==== RQ2
Which implementation-level factors (memory access patterns, GPU occupancy, redundant computation, data layout, host-device transfers) contribute most to the performance gap in existing reference implementations?

==== RQ3
Can a systematically engineered, production-grade reimplementation of a recent state-of-the-art method recover a substantial fraction of the runtime and memory cost while preserving its benchmark accuracy?

==== RQ4
What software engineering and performance optimization practices should the MVS research community adopt to prevent the continued accumulation of avoidable overhead in future methods?
//  this is answerable from the paper-versus-release findings plus the literature above. Its tone is brief item 15.

/*
short 3D reconstruction and Dense MVS intro, contains the formulation of patch match algorithm and focuses on early patch match implementaion. Also intros the general structure of MVS programs and ETH3D as a benchmarking target.

make sure we include enough GPU and performance optimization background to cover methodology and results sections. Especially considering the deep analysis.

The goal of 3D reconstruction is to recover consistent 3D structural information of a scene or a 3D model of specific objects, from multiple 2D sources such as images, depth maps, and active sensing approaches such as structured light, time-of-flight sensors, or directly from range measurements (LiDAR).

Photogrammetry defines the approach to recover 3D information and measurements mainly from imagery. A traditional photogrammetry-based 3D reconstruction pipeline obtains a 3D representation from multiple images captured by a set of uncalibrated imaging devices and consists of two major steps:
- Pose estimation: finding the instrinsic and extrinsic (relative position and orientation) calibration of the imaging devices from a set of images. @hartley_zisserman_mvg
- Dense reconstruction: creating a dense representation of the scene, such as point clouds, mesh models, and volumetric representations (voxel grids).

In this work we are focusing on _Multi-View Stereo_ (MVS) dense reconstruction. Given a set of calibrated cameras and images observing the same scene from different view points, use stereopsis to find 3D depth information for image pixels.


/*
4. A cost model
Per reference image, cost is pixels × source views × patch taps × iterations × passes. The Literature Review can then place each lineage step as “multiplies term X”, using compendium §2.2’s numbers. That turns a list of papers into an argument.

= Literature review

describes the lineage and selected methods that the thesis considers. shows and analyzes the algorithmic improvements and what added costs these have. Also analyzes the software source code a bit.

also include
- prior optimizaiton work on CUMVS -> third-party evidence that optimization headroom exists
- lineage and code sharing evidence
- maybe cost of each improvement (referring to the later benchmarking section)

watch out for this not to blow up! we have a lot of methods, and deeply analysing all of them can take a lot of time. The focus should be on the methodology and the results sections instead of this!
- consider analysing only a few key papers, and mentioning others that are less relevant
  - acm family
  - APD-MVS
  - HPM-MVS
  - (maybe MP-MVS or DPE-MVS)

prior mvs efficiency work:
- Bailer/Zheng parallel sweeps
- Gipuma Checkerboard propagation
- OpenMVS ACMH
- SURE
- CUMVS

prior algorithmic cost cutting work as optimization
- SURE (Stuttgart dense matching software built on SGM): an example from photogrammetry where efficiency engineering is what made dense matching practical
  - SURE: Photogrammetric Surface Reconstruction from Imagery", LC3D Workshop, Berlin, 2012
    - 21.1GB -> 1.3GB memory usage through optimization work
  - "SURE - The ifp Software for Dense Image Matching", Photogrammetric Week '13, 2013.
    - 36 (135 megapixels) aerial images in 4h 37min 

prior algorithmic vs implementation work:
- Leiserson 2020 (focusing on software optimizations and engineering of research). Python matrix multiply 25 552 s → 0.41 s, 62 806x from engineering alone.

prior benchmarking culture:
- "The Efficiency Misnomer" and "Green AI" show a similar trend in AI happening right now -> benchmarks and leaderboards competing only on quality disregarding cost and efficiency
- Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, "Utility is in the Eye of the User" (EMNLP 2020) saying that highly inefficient models provide less utility to practitioners but not to a leaderboard, since it is a cost that only the former must bear. Also "To allow practitioners to better estimate a model's utility to them, we advocate for more transparency on leaderboards, such as the reporting of statistics that are of practical concern (e.g., model size, energy efficiency, and inference latency)."
- Gipuma's 2015 complaint
  - "Nevertheless, guided by the quality metrics used in standard benchmarks such as KITTI and Middlebury, most authors concentrate on accuracy and pay limited attention to scalability and runtime performance. Many existing algorithms become impractical when moving to larger sets of high-resolution images."
  - This is a strong support saying that this is also what is happening in ETH3D with PatchMatch-based MVS, and efficiency and cost is not incentivized. Making these methods stand out in leaderboards but fail in real-world adaptability.
    - Should introduce KITTI and Middlebury as two-view stereo benchmark before ETH3D
    - Also Gipuma authors are included in ETH3D authors and they said that their 24MP images would encourage efficient methods, yet they rank only by F1 and stating the runtime is not crucial in submitting to them!
    The ETH3D paper says more about efficiency than we had. It has four passages:
      1. p. 1: the 24 MP images "encourage the development of memory and computationally efficient methods which can handle very large datasets."
      2. p. 1: the video scenario "rewards efficient algorithms which can handle large amounts of data."
      3. p. 7: the methods "take in the order of several minutes to an hour" on the video sequences, "underlining the need for more efficient algorithms".
      4. p. 8, Conclusion: "One of these challenges is efficient processing of large amounts of data ... These challenges are far from being solved and there is significant room for improvement."
    > In 2015, Gipuma's authors observed that benchmark metrics led authors to neglect runtime [p. 1]. Two of them co-authored ETH3D, whose paper names efficient processing of large data as an open challenge [p. 8], and the benchmark requests a runtime with every submission. It ranks by F1 alone, however, and as of 30 October 2026 the lineage's leading entries report placeholder runtimes. The challenge was posed but never scored.
